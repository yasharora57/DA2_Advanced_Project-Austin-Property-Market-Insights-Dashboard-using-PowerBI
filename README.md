## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation & Modeling

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Imported the Excel dataset and created a cleaned reference table.
   - Disabled load for unused tables to optimize performance.

2. **Fact & Dimension Tables**
   - Built a central fact table `housing_fact`.
   - Created 5 dimension tables: `features`, `house`, `school`, `location`, `description`.
   - Assigned surrogate keys to all dim tables (except `location` and `description`).

3. **Relationships & Cardinality**
   - Defined relationships:
     - `location` ‚Üî `housing_fact`: 1:1
     - `description` ‚Üí `housing_fact`: Many:1
     - All others: Many:1 (from Fact to Dim)

4. **Snowflake Schema**
   - Further normalized the `description` table into `word_summary_pqe`, creating a snowflake schema for detailed keyword-level insights.

5. **Optimization**
   - Normalization reduced overall file size by **~40%**, improving report performance and manageability.
